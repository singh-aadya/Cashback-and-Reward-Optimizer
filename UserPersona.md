## Priya â€“ The Busy Professional  
*"I earn well, I spend a lotâ€¦ but I have no clue where my rewards go.*  

Every month, I use **6 different apps** â€“ Paytm, Google Pay, HDFC, SBI, Amazon Pay, PhonePe.  
I know Iâ€™m earning rewards, butâ€¦  
- Theyâ€™re scattered everywhere.  
- Half the time I forget to redeem.  
- Last month I lost **â‚¹1,200 worth of points** because they expired.  

I wish there was **one place** to see it all instantly, like a â€˜bank accountâ€™ for rewards. One tap â€“ done."

## Rajesh â€“ The Business Owner  
*"Running my restaurant means every rupee counts.*  

I spend over **â‚¹1.5 lakh a month** on supplies. I have multiple cards, but I never know:  
- Which one gives the **best cashback** on a given purchase?  
- Am I missing out on thousands of rupees?  

Once I paid for office furniture with the wrong card â€“ lost **â‚¹2,000 in cashback**. Painful.  

I want a system that says:  
ðŸ‘‰ *â€˜For this purchase, use SBI Business Card â€“ youâ€™ll save â‚¹250.â€™*  

No guesswork. Just smart recommendations."

## Sunita â€“ The Homemaker  
*"I manage the household on a tight budget.*  

Cashback and offers are exciting, but:  
- I keep forgetting expiry dates.  
- Once, **â‚¹500 Paytm cashback vanished overnight**.  
- Too many rules, too much confusion.  

If something could just **remind me before points expire** and tell me which rewards to use first,  
Iâ€™d never lose my hard-earned savings again."

## The Common Pain  
Across Priya, Rajesh, and Sunitaâ€™s stories, the frustrations repeat:  
- Rewards are **scattered and invisible**.  
- **Wrong payment choices** = lost money.  
- Points **expire silently**.  
- Redemption feels like a maze.

## The Dream Solution  
*"If only there was one app that could:*  
- **Show all my rewards in one place** (like a wallet)  
- **Tell me the best card/app to use instantly**  
- **Alert me before points expire**  
- **Track my savings and missed opportunities**  
- **Offer flexible redemption (cash, UPI, gift cards)**  

*That would finally make my rewards feel like real money â€“ not Monopoly money."*
