# Cashback & Rewards Optimizer

A Java command-line app that helps users find the best cashback rewards across payment platforms, using HashMap, Min-Heap, PriorityQueue, and Graph algorithms to make smart, real-time savings decisions.

# 1. INTRODUCTION & PROBLEM STATEMENT

## 1.1 Background
The digital payment ecosystem in India features over 50+ cashback applications across categories like UPI payments, e-commerce, dining, and credit cards. Users lose approximately ₹2,000+ monthly due to suboptimal payment method selection, representing a ₹14 billion market inefficiency.

## 1.2 Problem Definition
- **Manual Decision Making**: Users cannot instantly compare cashback rates across multiple platforms  
- **Missed Opportunities**: Rewards expire unnoticed due to lack of centralized tracking  
- **Optimization Complexity**: Multi-constraint decision making requires algorithmic approach  

## 1.3 Proposed Solution
A Java CLI tool leveraging three core DSA concepts:  

- **HashMap**: O(1) cashback rate lookups  
- **Min-Heap (PriorityQueue)**: Automated expiry management  
- **Graph Algorithms**: Multi-platform optimization

## Key Problems with Rewards Systems

- **Too Many Apps** → Hard to track, can't combine points, confusing rules.  
- **Difficult Redemption** → Multi-step, unclear usage, many give up.  
- **Points Expire** → No reminders, 50% lose rewards.  
- **Lack of Awareness** → Most don’t know benefits or total rewards.  
- **Bad Info Sources** → Depend on influencers, often misled.  
- **Low Value Perception** → 42% think rewards aren't worth it.  
- **No Smart Optimization** → 97% don’t maximize rewards, still use cash/UPI.  
- **System Competition** → UPI, credit cards, loyalty programs don’t integrate.  

## Impact
- Users lose **thousands of rupees yearly** in unclaimed rewards.  
- Companies struggle to keep customers engaged.
