# Cashback & Rewards Optimizer

A Java command-line app that helps users find the best cashback rewards across payment platforms, using HashMap, Min-Heap, PriorityQueue, and Graph algorithms to make smart, real-time savings decisions.

## 1. INTRODUCTION & PROBLEM STATEMENT

## 1.1 Background
The digital payment ecosystem in India features over 50+ cashback applications across categories like UPI payments, e-commerce, dining, and credit cards. Users lose approximately ₹2,000+ monthly due to suboptimal payment method selection, representing a ₹14 billion market inefficiency.

## 1.2 Problem Definition
- **Manual Decision Making**: Users cannot instantly compare cashback rates across multiple platforms  
- **Missed Opportunities**: Rewards expire unnoticed due to lack of centralized tracking  
- **Optimization Complexity**: Multi-constraint decision making requires algorithmic approach  

## 1.3 Proposed Solution
A Java CLI tool leveraging three core DSA concepts:  

- **HashMap**: O(1) cashback rate lookups  
- **Min-Heap (PriorityQueue)**: Automated expiry management  
- **Graph Algorithms**: Multi-platform optimization
