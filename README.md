## Key Problems with Rewards Systems

- **Too Many Apps** → Hard to track, can't combine points, confusing rules.  
- **Difficult Redemption** → Multi-step, unclear usage, many give up.  
- **Points Expire** → No reminders, 50% lose rewards.  
- **Lack of Awareness** → Most don’t know benefits or total rewards.  
- **Bad Info Sources** → Depend on influencers, often misled.  
- **Low Value Perception** → 42% think rewards aren't worth it.  
- **No Smart Optimization** → 97% don’t maximize rewards, still use cash/UPI.  
- **System Competition** → UPI, credit cards, loyalty programs don’t integrate.  

## Impact
- Users lose **thousands of rupees yearly** in unclaimed rewards.  
- Companies struggle to keep customers engaged.
