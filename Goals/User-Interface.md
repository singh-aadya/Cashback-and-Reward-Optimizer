# 💡 Where Users Get Best Payment Method Recommendations

## 🖥️ Primary: Standalone CLI Application
- Users input purchase details (e.g., `optimize grocery 1000`)  
- System analyzes all linked accounts in real time  
- Returns **optimal payment method** (e.g., *“Use HDFC Card → ₹40 cashback (4%)”*)  

## ⚡ Real-Time Query Process
1. User enters category + amount in CLI  
2. Optimizer checks **all connected platforms** via DSAs  
3. Instant recommendation delivered in <1s  
4. User completes payment on chosen UPI/Wallet/Card app  

## 🎯 Pre-Purchase Decision Support
- Acts as a **“financial advisor”** before user opens Paytm, GPay, or bank app  
- Ensures **maximum savings per transaction**  

## 🔮 Future Integration Potential
- APIs for direct embedding in UPI/payment apps  
- Browser extensions for **e-commerce auto-optimization**  
- Long-term roadmap: real-time in-app recommendations
