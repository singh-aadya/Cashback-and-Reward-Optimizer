# ðŸš€ Why Make This Project?

- **Massive Market Problem**: Tackles a **$14B fragmented market** where users lose thousands annually due to expired rewards and poor payment choices.  
- **Advanced DSA Application**: Applies **hash maps, heaps, and graphs** in a real-world, performance-critical financial system with **mathematical optimization guarantees**.  
- **High Growth Opportunity**: Targets **350M+ digital payment users in India** who currently lack a unified reward optimizer â€” delivering value to both **users and merchants**.  
- **Fintech Innovation**: Solves **system interoperability challenges** with a **privacy-first, security-conscious design**, aligning with modern fintech demands.
