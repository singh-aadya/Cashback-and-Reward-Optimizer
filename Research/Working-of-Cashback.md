# **How Cashback Works**

## **Basic Concept**
Cashback is a **reward system where you get a percentage of your purchase amount returned to you as cash**. When you spend money using a participating credit card, debit card, or app, a portion of that amount is credited back to your account.[2][5]

## **Simple Example**
- You buy groceries for ₹1,000 using a credit card with 2% cashback
- You earn ₹20 cashback (2% of ₹1,000)
- This ₹20 gets credited to your account for future use[2]

## **How the Mechanism Works**

### **Step-by-Step Process** :[4]
1. **You make a purchase** using a cashback-enabled payment method
2. **Transaction tracking** occurs through cookies or special URLs when you click through cashback platforms
3. **Purchase confirmation** is sent to the cashback provider
4. **Cashback calculation** happens based on predetermined rates
5. **Money is credited** to your cashback account
6. **You can redeem** the accumulated cashback

### **Behind the Scenes** :[4]
- **Merchants pay commission fees** to payment processors and cashback platforms
- **A portion of this commission is shared with you** as cashback rewards
- **Tracking systems** (cookies, affiliate networks) ensure you get credit for purchases made through their platform

## **Types of Cashback Structures**[5][6]

### **1. Flat-Rate Cashback**
- **Fixed percentage** on all purchases (e.g., 1.5% on everything)
- **Simple and straightforward** - no category restrictions

### **2. Tiered/Category-Based Cashback** 
- **Different rates for different categories**
- Example: 5% on fuel, 3% on groceries, 1% on other purchases[6]

### **3. Rotating Categories**
- **Higher rates on specific categories** that change quarterly
- Example: 5% on dining for Q1, 5% on travel for Q2[5]

### **4. Merchant-Specific Cashback**
- **Higher rates at partnered merchants**
- Special deals through affiliate relationships[4]

## **How Cashback is Funded**[7]

The money for cashback comes from:
- **Interchange fees** that merchants pay to credit card companies (typically 2-3% of transaction)
- **Affiliate commissions** from merchants to cashback platforms
- **A portion of these fees is shared with consumers** as cashback rewards

**It's not "free money"** - it's a marketing cost that merchants pay to acquire and retain customers.[6]

## **Redemption Options**[5]

You can typically redeem cashback as:
- **Statement credit** (reduces your credit card balance)
- **Direct bank deposit** 
- **Gift cards** (sometimes with bonus value)
- **Merchandise** through reward catalogs
- **Travel bookings**

## **Key Requirements**[6]
- **Minimum redemption thresholds** (usually ₹25-₹100)
- **Eligible purchase criteria** (some transactions excluded)
- **Account must be in good standing**
- **Time limits** on earning and redeeming rewards

## **Why Businesses Offer Cashback**[3][7]

1. **Customer acquisition** - attract new users with immediate value
2. **Customer retention** - encourage repeat purchases
3. **Increased spending** - higher transaction amounts
4. **Data collection** - track customer behavior and preferences
5. **Brand loyalty** - create emotional connection with rewards

**Bottom Line**: Cashback works by sharing a portion of the fees that merchants pay to payment processors back to consumers as an incentive to use specific payment methods or shop through particular platforms.[2][4][6]
