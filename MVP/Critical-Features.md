# 🚀 MVP: Critical Feature Review

## ✅ KEEP (Core Must-Haves)
- **Basic Purchase Optimization** → User inputs category + amount → CLI returns best payment method (primary problem solved instantly).  
- **Simple Account Linking** → Manual rate entry or basic API calls for 2–3 major platforms (Paytm, HDFC, GPay).  
- **Hash Map Rate Storage** → Store/retrieve cashback rates by category/platform (DSA core showcase).  

## ❌ REMOVE (Nice-to-Haves for Later)
- ~~Reward expiry tracking (heap)~~ → Too complex for MVP.  
- ~~Transaction history~~ → Database overhead, non-essential for demo.  
- ~~Advanced analytics dashboard~~ → UI work distracts from core algorithms.  
- ~~Multi-platform auto-sync~~ → Manual entry fine for MVP.  
- ~~Personalized recommendations~~ → ML complexity unnecessary at start.  
- ~~Real-time notifications~~ → Infrastructure heavy, not MVP-critical.  

## 🎯 MVP Reality Check
**Core Value Proposition:**  
*"Tell me the best cashback option for this purchase right now."*  

Anything beyond this = feature creep that delays learning and launch.
